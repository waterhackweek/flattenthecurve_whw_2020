# The US healthcare system is not well enough prepared. No one is

In the USA, our health care capacity is under 1 million staffed beds; this is not adequate to accommodate the number of [hospitalizations we
are expected to see (4-8 million)](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu). Johns Hopkins University did a 3-year global survey of pandemic preparedness. Although the USA ranked at the top of the countries, even the US only [scored a 42 out of 100.](https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/pandemic-influenza-and-major-disease-outbreak-preparedness-in-us--7) We simply don't have the equipment, training, or messaging in place and
we need to ramp up fast. No one does. That is why your choices today matter so much.

And those of us with Italian colleagues in the north (hit hardest) know they have exceptional physicians, infectious disease docs and
immunologists. And effectively universal care. [This is not a developing-world tale that is irrelevant for the US situation.](https://twitter.com/drkomanduri/status/1236720751073546240)
