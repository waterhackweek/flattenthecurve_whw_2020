# This is not a normal flu
**Not even in the best case**

The World Health Organization estimate of 3.5% mortality rate is an average across age groups, and they have provided large surveillance data as evidence against high numbers of asymptomatic cases. There is very strong consensus that those aged 60+ and those with underlying conditions are the most impacted.

Earlier in the epidemic, there was hope that 3.5 percent was grossly overestimated, however as evidence continues to emerge, there is [dwindling support for that hope](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/). The numbers out of South Korea are so far the most optimistic in the world ([0.7% cases were fatal](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1236914078632812544)); however, a) the South Korean population is younger on average and b) South Korea (in contrast to the USA) have been doing everything right from the earliest stages of the outbreak: they have done massive roll out of testing coupled with radical transparency, public support and [brilliant drive-through testing!](https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1234524871226482688) If this strain of Coronavirus is like other viruses, aggressive measures that reduce transmission, may also lower the average ‘dose’ of viral particles that cause any given case; this might reduce the average severity of disease and decrease overall death rates. Time will tell.

Moreover, even IF the true Covid-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% ([as it is so far with the Diamond Princess](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article)), that would already be [ten times higher than a typical seasonal flu](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).

> The 61,099 flu-related deaths in the U.S. during the severe flu season of 2017-2018 amounted to 0.14% of the estimated 44.8 million cases of influenza-like illness. There were also an estimated flu-related 808,129 hospitalizations, for a rate of 1.8%. Assume a Covid-19 outbreak of similar size in the U.S., multiply the death and hospitalization estimates by five or 10, and you get some really scary numbers: 300,000 to 600,000 deaths, and [4 million to 8 million hospitalizations in a country that has 924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu) \[for all illnesses combined\].

For most people, infection results in a mild but still transmissible illness; **that is how it spreads.** Those that get severe illness are hit really hard. Mortality is not the full picture: Italy reports that [10% of cases need not just hospitalization but also ICU
care](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232) -- and they need that care over a period of [3-6 weeks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/07/how-doctors-treat-sickest-coronavirus-patients/). This is unsustainable.
