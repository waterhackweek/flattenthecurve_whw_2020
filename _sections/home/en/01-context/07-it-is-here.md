# It is here

Assume that the virus is already in your city / town / workplace / church / etc. It [almost certainly is "here" and is simply not yet
detected](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1234879748083503105) due to the shortage of tests. Moreover there are [6 states that still don't
have a single lab ready to carry out the test](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/06/812833596/coronavirus-14-deaths-now-in-u-s-new-cases-in-maryland-colorado) even if they had one in their hands. Estimates from Italy are that in
the early outbreak, the number of actual infections was [four times the number of cases than it was possible to confirm at the
time](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1236004937529798659). Cryptic transmission in the community was [happening for weeks before it
was detected in Seattle](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1236096904678633472). Seattle and Stanford are doing an amazing job of getting up to speed with their own testing kits; [about 5-7% of tests in Seattle are positive](https://twitter.com/UWVirology/status/1236017803162873856) and
anyone (with a doctor's indication) can be tested.

> Frustrated by the lack of testing resulting from the problem with the CDC-developed kit, the Seattle Flu Study began using an in-house developed test to look for Covid-19 in samples from people who had tested negative for flu. That work —permissible because it was research— uncovered the Snohomish County teenager.

(For the sake of public health, University of Washington are publishing these results). So far only UW and Stanford have been moving ahead with
their own (non-CDC) testing; both of these institutions have mandated that in-person classes be moved to distance learning alternatives. That
speaks for itself; more universities should follow suit. That said, [professors need the technology and support to make this switch](https://twitter.com/ryanaboyd/status/1236009378295103488).

Education communities that are resource-poor (without laptops or internet) would have the hardest time doing this switch. So let's start
with those universities (and disciplines) for whom this switch is not such a major hardship. There is no one-size-fits-all intervention, but
speed is key. Professors, please don't wait for your [university administration to make the decision campus wide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/06/roundup-weeks-news-about-colleges-and-coronavirus?utm_content=buffera0fc5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=IHEbuffer). Move to a distance-based option of your own accord. [Check out these tips for teaching online in a pinch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR7IEgdisO6JtmELs07uUsSSu2Yox86GJY9wGV6mBjA/edit#).
