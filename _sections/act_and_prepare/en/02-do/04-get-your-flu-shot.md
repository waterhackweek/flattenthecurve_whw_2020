### Get your flu shot (and if you're 60+, pneumonia vaccine)

Better late than never. The flu vaccine won't protect you at all against Coronavirus. However it DOES reduce your likelihood of contracting flu. And therefore your likelihood of needing to be hospitalized, which also reduces your chances of contracting Coronavirus while you are there. If you're 60+ get your pneumonia vaccine as well for the same reason.
