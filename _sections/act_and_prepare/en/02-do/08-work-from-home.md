### Work from home

### If you can work from home, do so as much

Not everyone can work from home (WFH) 100% of the time; that is ok. Part time WFH is better than none. Don't wait for your employer to mandate
WFH for everyone. Ask your manager if it would be permissible for you personally. Encourage your colleagues.

If you can WFH, do it *precisely* because your barber, your kid's teacher, your local restaurant staff, your barista, and your doctors etc. can not.

Great software now makes distance collaboration easier than ever. My personal favorites are below. The choice of collaboration tools isn't important: use whatever works for you and your team.

-   Google drive (collaborative documents) is free
-   Zoom.us (video conferencing) is free up to 40 mins,
-   Slack/Gitter (free instant messaging).
-   Skype is also free and works pretty well for videoconferencing with 2 people at a time.

Do a dry run. See what is missing so that you're ready for when it is not optional. Some resources [here](https://twitter.com/BadassBowden/status/1235793674174435328) for people with ADHD working from home for the first time.
