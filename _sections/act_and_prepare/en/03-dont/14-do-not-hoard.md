### Do not hoard supplies 

Items can easily become in short supply due to hoarding.  Common products experiencing shortages include toilet paper, bottled water, and medical supplies.

Avoid purchasing large quantities of products, particularly those in short supply.  Get what you need for 2-4 weeks. Leave the rest for others who need it.  If you have a large quantity of surgical/N95 masks or other supplies consider donating it to groups in need such as healthcare providers or a local food pantry.
