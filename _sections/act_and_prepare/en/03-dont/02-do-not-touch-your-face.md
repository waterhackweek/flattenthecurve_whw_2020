### Do not touch your face

[That is the most common way the virus enters the body.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html)
It is really hard to avoid; this is also why we advise staying home and avoiding crowds. It is also why top-down measures (event cancellation and imposed quarantine etc) work. The average person, even ones with baseline good hygiene, touch their faces constantly already without thinking about it. Especially with allergy season coming up, please keep this in mind.
