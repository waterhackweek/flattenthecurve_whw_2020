### Do not be careless

Don't be that person. It might not be about you but it is everyone's problem. Don't be careless in the hopes you get sick when you can "avoid
the rush." There is zero benefit to individuals or the population to getting sick early in the pandemic. You would be putting the lives of others at risk. It is not just that people are dying, but how they are dying. To say nothing of the physical trauma, emotionally speaking this is the opposite of a "good death". People are dying alone, quarantined from those they love.

Early reports are that people who recover develop antibodies that provide immunity if they are infected with the same strain again. However, this is great news for vaccine development, so flatten the curve and wait it out.

This can get very serious; one person described the pain as feeling like her lungs were being [put through a pasta maker](https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236517734189391875). 10% of cases require ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Even if autopsy reports from China have been
[misrepresented](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1235797950451703809) or overstated, there is a possibility of long term or permanent lung
damage if you do get sick and recover. There are lot of gaps in the information about lung damage, mostly because everyone qualified to let the public know exactly what is going on is already very busy saving lives and putting their own at risk.
