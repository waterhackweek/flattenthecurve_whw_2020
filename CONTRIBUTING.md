# Guiding Principles
We ask all contributors to please embrace the following principles while participating and when relevant:

1. Be science-based - seek always primary sources
1. Only provide information that can be acted upon
1. Avoid politics, opinions, and personal comments
1. Keep content clear and accessible
1. Have empathy for all involved and avoid promoting fear
1. Promote diversity and inclusion, especially the most vulnerable to COVID-19
1. Collaborate with other groups to make information widely available
1. Be the change ourselves

These guiding principles, as well as [the project's code of conduct](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), represent the ways in which we expect our community to act.

We need to keep the information updated with recent developments and recommendations. In this role you can edit any portion of content and create a pull request to have a reviewer confirm and approve your editing. See the following links for the English content for the [home page](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/tree/master/_sections/home/en) and the [act & prepare page](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/tree/master/_sections/act_and_prepare/en). Under each of those folders, there is a subfolder for each topic, under which there are files for each section.
