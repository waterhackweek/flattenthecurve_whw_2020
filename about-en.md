As we learn more about COVID-19, a simple graph has gone viral: “Flatten the Curve.” Praised for shedding light on the scale and speed of the outbreak, it illustrates the wave of expected COVID-19 cases.

- A high curve means the virus is spreading quickly; some people won’t get the medical care they need, and the number of deaths is likely to increase.
- A flattened curve means COVID-19 is spreading slowly, staggering the rate of people with COVID-19 and giving doctors time to best utilize scarce resources to treat people and save lives. 

## Purpose
We can all slow the spread of COVID-19 and “Flatten the Curve” together. This site provides reliable information reviewed by scientists delivered in as many languages as possible to help:
1. Understand when and how to protect ourselves;
2. Understand how to self-isolate, quarantine, and help others stay healthy;
3. Increase our knowledge about COVID-19 and related trends; 
4. Avoid panic and trauma by providing everyone with the right information, when we need it, and in our own language;
5. Provide access to resources to expedite research and collaboration, such as information to participate in clinical trials.

Flatten the Curve is a collective effort of people, including scientists and health experts. We are not speaking on behalf of organizations or trying to duplicate official communication channels.
